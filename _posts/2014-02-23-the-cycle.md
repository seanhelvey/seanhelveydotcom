I have been thinking a lot about economic cycles lately with the surge in speculative activity during the first quarter of 2014 and Facebook&#8217;s recent $19 billion takeover of WhatsApp. This is the 4th largest technology acquisition in history and there have been a record breaking $42.4 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions in the first month and a half of 2014 according to <a title="Thomson Reuters" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/10652681/facebook-whatsapp-bubble.html" target="_blank">Thomson Reuters</a>.<a title="Thomson Reuters" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/digital-media/10652681/facebook-whatsapp-bubble.html" target="_blank"><br /> </a>

It is clear that <a title="fear" href="http://www.wallstreetdaily.com/2013/12/13/merger-arbitrage-investing/" target="_blank">fear</a>, which overcomes financial markets every 5-10 years, is on the back-burner at the moment. With Y Combinator founded in 2005, TechStars in 2006, outspoken venture capitalists <a title="blogging" href="http://avc.com/about" target="_blank">blogging</a> daily and <a title="tweeting" href="https://twitter.com/cdixon" target="_blank">tweeting</a> about the hottest trends in tech, it seems as if people have forgotten or don&#8217;t care to remember about <a title="past failures" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/business2_archive/2005/07/01/8265499/" target="_blank">past failures</a>.

The biggest red flag that I see right now is the use of alternative valuation metrics. Just like &#8220;clicks&#8221; and &#8220;eyeballs&#8221; during the dot-com bubble, everyone seems to have their own way of justifying sky high prices. $40 per active user, 450 million average daily users, $345 million per employee, etc.

<a title="My favorite" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html" target="_blank">My favorite</a> Paul Graham essay is contained in a book that I happened upon in the Courant Library called &#8220;Hackers & Painters&#8221;, but one of his more recent writings &#8220;Startup = Growth&#8221; has me intrigued. He makes the distinction between a business and a startup, claiming that the defining feature of a startup is <a title="growth" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html" target="_blank">growth</a>.

> &#8220;But I also mean startups are different by nature, in the same way a redwood seedling has a different destiny from a bean sprout.&#8221; &#8211; Paul Graham, Y Combinator

But I don&#8217;t see anything about growth in the following definition:

> &#8220;Intrinsic value can be defined simply: It is the discounted value of the cash that can be taken out of a business during its remaining life.&#8221; &#8211; Warren E. Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway

The best way to differentiate between bean sprouts and redwoods is intrinsic value. There is no telling when the &#8220;animal spirits&#8221; will subside, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see the market soar up to new highs, but in the end stock prices will reflect the value of the underlying businesses.
