I had some free time over the last couple of weeks and decided to take a little road trip. Even though I spent four years in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, I had never made my way up <a title="Highway 1" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/98311880@N06/sets/72157634443218211/" target="_blank">Highway 1</a>, and it seemed like a good excuse to explore the California coast.

It has been over five years since I finished school there and a lot has changed. There are great new <a title="coffee shops" href="http://kreuzbergcalifornia.com/" target="_blank">coffee shops</a> in downtown SLO, a freshly built staircase leading down to our favorite hangout Shell Beach, and San Francisco seems much different now after living in New York City.

While Big Sur was cool, I was most impressed with <a title="Big Basin Redwoods State Park" href="http://www.bigbasin.org/" target="_blank">Big Basin Redwoods State Park</a> in the mountains outside of Santa Cruz. I saw trees there that were several thousand years old and almost three hundred feet tall. One day I would like to return and check out the <a title="Skyline to the Sea Trail" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline-to-the-Sea_Trail" target="_blank">Skyline to the Sea Trail</a> when I am more comfortable with hiking and camping.

I enjoyed the elephant seals near San Simeon and was lucky enough to spot a couple of california condors along the way. Take a look at the <a title="Flickr set" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/98311880@N06/sets/72157634443218211/" target="_blank">Flickr set</a> and let me know if you have any questions about the trip. I have some big life news coming next week, so definitely stay tuned!
