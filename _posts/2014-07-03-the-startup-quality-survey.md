Blue Hook published the <a href="/the-startup-quality-survey/" target="_blank">Startup Quality Survey</a> in May of 2014 to collect data for a report analyzing relationships between different characteristics of tech startups.

The survey is unique because of its structure. 10 well crafted questions are followed by 5 &#8220;meta&#8221; questions which add an additional layer of complexity to the resulting data.

The survey was a hit, especially in startup communities like Boulder, and it has been re-releasedÂ for a second run. Sean Helvey, the Founder of Blue Hook, will be speaking about the survey at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Analyze-Boulder/" target="_blank">Analyze Boulder Meetup</a> on Wednesday, August 6th.
