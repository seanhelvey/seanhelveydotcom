  <h1 class="page-heading">About</h1>

    <p>
    I started programming in quantitative finance classes at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly SLO</a> and built option pricing models on Wall Street before pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at NYU's <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/">Courant Institute</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since moving to Boulder I have worked at startups, agencies, and large corporations. I ran my own consulting business called <a href="http://www.bluehook.co/">Blue Hook</a> for three years before starting a full-time role with <a href="http://www.seanhelvey.com/life-update/">Pearson</a> last fall. I have extensive expertise in JavaScript, but am currently more focused on machine learning systems using Python, Go, MongoDB, and Docker.

    <p>
    I spend my free time organizing the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Elm-user-group-Boulder/">Elm User Group Boulder</a>, working on <a href="http://www.valunicorn.me/">Valunicorn</a>, and learning functional programming (Î»). I enjoy surfing, reading, meditation, yoga, climbing, and riding bikes. I also like table tennis, foosball, disc golf, and board games. Please feel free to reach out!
