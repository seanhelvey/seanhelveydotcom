What an experience! I met so many fantastic people and learned a bunch at the <a title="Longmont Hackathon" href="http://longmonthackathon.com/" target="_blank">Longmont Hackathon</a> this past weekend. Skyline High School was well represented with a team of incredibly gifted young developers, but the star of the show was <a title="14-year-old Jackson Roberts" href="http://www.timescall.com/news/longmont-local-news/ci_23032800/sunset-middle-school-student-wins-first-longmont-hackathon" target="_blank">14-year-old Jackson Roberts</a> who took 1st place with his &#8220;Longmont Events&#8221; application.

For my application, I decided to build a fire hydrant locator. Initially this was a simple <a title="web application" href="http://www.dev.seanhelvey.com/longmont/" target="_blank">web application</a> which utilized the <a title="Esri ArcGIS API for JavaScript" href="http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/" target="_blank">Esri ArcGIS API for JavaScript</a> along with the City of Longmont&#8217;s ArcGIS REST Services Directory which is hosted by <a title="OpenColorado" href="http://data.opencolorado.org/group/city-of-longmont" target="_blank">OpenColorado</a>. I used PhoneGap for the first time and was pleasantly surprised with the resulting Android application, but the iOS version turned out to be a little buggy. Links to the PhoneGap build and GitHub repository are available <a title="here" href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/longmont-hackathon/hacks/find-a-hydrant" target="_blank">here</a> via Hacker League.

I was already looking forward to the <a title="Boulder Civic Hackfest" href="http://hackforchange.org/boulder-civic-hackfest" target="_blank">Boulder Civic Hackfest</a> which is coming up on the weekend of June 1-2, but this event made me even more excited! Seeing talented engineers of all ages coming together to hack for a cause is something that I love, and I can only imagine what will come out of it. Special thanks to the <a title="City of Longmont" href="http://www.ci.longmont.co.us/" target="_blank">City of Longmont </a>for taking a chance and hosting an amazing event.
