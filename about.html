  <h1 class="page-heading">About</h1>

    <p>
    I started programming in quantitative finance classes at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly SLO</a> and
    built option pricing models on Wall Street before completing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at NYU's <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/">Courant
      Institute</a>.

  <p>
    After living in Colorado for 7 years, I've come full-circle returning to California, and joining the engineering team at <a href="http://engineering.appfolio.com/">AppFolio</a>. I love practicing mindfulness, being outside, in the water, or drinking coffee / tea / beer. Please feel free to reach out!
