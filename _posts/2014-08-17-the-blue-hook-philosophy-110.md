> &#8220;Are you proud of the work that you are doing within your organization?&#8221;

Employees feel proud when they are able to work at or near their full potential. Think of the last time you were pleased with your results. It is highly likely that the conditions and environment around you were conducive to your success. Proactive management, effective communication within teams, including people in decision making, and valuing different perspectives are all great ways to develop pride within your company.

Passively listening to employees or holding occasional performance reviews is not enough to empower your team to achieve success. This is a full-time job. Approaching everyday with your workers at the center of your attention will help to scale your output and enable the business to deliver what clients need. Your employees each have the potential to identify problems, suggest alternatives, and construct solutions. Cultivate this aggressively!

Teams of technical professionals are faced with additional challenges that might not otherwise be present. With a mid-stage tech startup for instance, a company of 20 employees might have over 10 software developers. If this group is broken down into smaller sub-groups, then communication will become more simple, and coordinating effort will be a breeze. With smaller teams, each individual not only feels more important, but there will be less rework and waste due to shifting priorities. This isn&#8217;t a panacea, but it is a step in the right direction in terms of fostering pride. More on this next chapter.

Smaller teams empower more people to become leaders, which brings us to another key point. If you include everyone in the decision making process instead of having a small circle of cronies shoving orders down the pipe, your employees are going to have the ability to do work that they are proud of. Technical employees in particular need their opinions to carry weight. When a sales person says X and an engineer says Y, the sales person must consider the long-term benefits of listening to the engineer, and the team will need to come to a conclusion on behalf of the business. Not the management.

Be leery of the teammates who never express discontent and hold the “negative” ones dear. Employees know that it isn&#8217;t endearing to say such things! Many times, the most pleasant and charismatic engineer is faking it, and their opinion is tainted Kool-Aid. Also, in group discussions, these characters tend to be more dominant. Pull the quiet ones aside, go on a long walk with them, or buy them a beer. Listen to what they have to say and weigh their opinion equally with the others.

Allow employees to enjoy their job and fulfill their role. Trust me, they really want to! If they aren&#8217;t able to, it is your responsibility as a manager to retool the system so that they can achieve results. Consider smaller teams and drive team members to come together when making business decisions. Remember that sometimes “rockstar” programmers get too much attention, and take a moment to work on your relationship with more irksome team members. The process will require continuous refinement, but creating a sense of pride within your company can be accomplished by staying focused on these principals.
