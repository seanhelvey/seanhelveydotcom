December Elm Hack Night has been cancelled, but Wednesday January 24th is [Beginner's Night](https://www.meetup.com/Front-range-elm/events/245365431/) at Front Range Elm. Please spread the word and bring your friends!

Here are some other Elm events happening in CO over the coming months:
* 12/4 6:30p [NoCo JS](https://www.meetup.com/NoCo-JavaScript-Meetup/events/243653786) - "What the Elm?" - [Slides / Code](https://github.com/seanhelvey/what-the-elm)
* 1/23 6:00p [DenverScript](https://www.meetup.com/DenverScript/events/244717323/) - Similar deck, maybe more of an emphasis on types
* 1/25 [Denver FP](https://www.meetup.com/denverfp/events/fzhgnnyxcbhc/) - Not confirmed, but I am proposing 2-3 people give 15-20m talks longer than lightning but more focused than a big 60m presentation. Please reach out of you are interested!
