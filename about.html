  <h1 class="page-heading">About</h1>

    <p>
    I started programming in quantitative finance classes at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly SLO</a> and
    built option pricing models on Wall Street before completing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at NYU's <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/">Courant
      Institute</a>. Most recently I was a Lead Instructor at Galvanize and a Senior Software Engineer at AppFolio.

  <p>
    I am grateful to have worked on amazing <a href="/projects.html">projects</a> both for the community and as a consultant with clients over the years. Currently I am available for contract work as a Full-Stack Developer, Team Lead, or Interim CTO. Please feel free to reach out directly or join the <a href="https://sbfreelance.github.io/" target="_blank">Santa Barbara Freelance</a> mailing list.
