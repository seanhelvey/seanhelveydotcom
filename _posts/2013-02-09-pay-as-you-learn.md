Be careful out there, kids! While many repayment plans are available to college graduates today, it is worth considering the implications of postponing interest payments. If you are going to maintain a Partial Financial Hardship (PFH) for the next 20-25 years, then Income Based Repayment (IBR) or Pay As You Earn (PAYE) may be good options for you, but what if you don&#8217;t?

Thank you, Mr. President!” -Heather Jarvis (<a title="Student Loan Expert" href="http://askheatherjarvis.com/blog/pay-as-you-earn-hotter-than-IBR" target="_blank">Student Loan Expert</a>)<a title="link" href="http://askheatherjarvis.com/blog/pay-as-you-earn-hotter-than-IBR" target="_blank"><br /> </a>

If you can&#8217;t maintain a PFH for the entire term of the loan, then the accrued interest that <a title="becomes capitalized" href="http://studentaid.ed.gov/sites/default/files/income-based-repayment-common-questions.pdf" target="_blank">becomes capitalized</a> might not be so “yummy”. That accrued interest is capped at 10% of the balance for the PAYE plan, but there is no cap for the IBR plan. PAYE is only applicable to _subsidized_ federal student loans anyway, so a majority of the student&#8217;s debt will most likely be accumulating interest.

Educate yourself before making a decision regarding your student loan repayment plan, or at least do some research before declaring these alternatives a <a title="panacea" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/opinion/relief-for-student-borrowers-in-pay-as-you-earn.html?_r=0" target="_blank">panacea</a>. Compound interest adds up quickly, and although lower payments may seem helpful right now, it could be painful for borrowers who haven&#8217;t read the fine print.
