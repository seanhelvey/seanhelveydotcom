I started a new project this weekend called <a title="BLDRPPL" href="http://www.bldrppl.com/" target="_blank">BLDRPPL</a>. There are so many interesting characters in this little town and I wanted an excuse to get to know them. Here is the basic idea:

&#8211; Regular interviews with community members focused on life in Boulder

&#8211; Questions are not scripted, but created collaboratively on the fly

&#8211; The person being interviewed suggests other local people that they admire

&#8211; We follow up with those people and feature them in future posts
