What do you do at <a href="http://www.bluehook.co/" target="_blank">Blue Hook</a>?

Good question! 3 months ago I started a business called Blue Hook. I wanted to continue building web applications for clients using JavaScript and Python, but was also curious about developing a consulting practice focused on teams of technical employees.

Since then, I have worked with a couple of amazing people on really cool projects. While much of the work has been purely back-end (Python, Django, PostgreSQL) other clients have wanted me to do user interface development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery). Some friends have also asked me for advice on their site&#8217;s user experience (UX) or guidance with their application design. I am happy to help.

We currently have capacity for 10-20 hours per week of software development. If you or your colleagues need front-end engineering, I am very comfortable building responsive websites and mobile-web applications. I love doing full-stack development too, so keep me in mind if you are looking for a Python/Django engineer.

Boulder is an incredible entrepreneurial community with a fantastic network of illustrators, graphic designers, and other specialists who I would be happy to collaborate with or refer you to. If you need support with Squarespace, WordPress, or any other CMS, I may be able to help. If not, I&#8217;ll do my best to point you in the right direction.

I think you will find that our output is higher quality and more affordable than comparable product from larger agencies. I will communicate directly with you and work hard to earn your trust, because I care about building a long-term relationship. Also, we don&#8217;t outsource &#8211; I write the code myself. Since we don&#8217;t have a fancy office full of employees, our rates are more competitive too.

On the consulting front, I have started researching engineering team dynamics. Check out my most recent <a href="http://slides.com/seanhelvey/startup-quality-survey/" target="_blank">slide deck</a> and learn about the <a href="/blue-hook-publishing-e-book/" target="_blank">e-book</a> I am working on. I am currently looking for a small company to work with on a pilot program. Please let me know if this is something that you are interested in talking more about.
