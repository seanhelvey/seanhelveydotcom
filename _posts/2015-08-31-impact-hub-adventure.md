As I&#8217;ve said <a href="http://www.seanhelvey.com/cross-pollination/" target="_blank">before</a>, I love being a member of Impact Hub Boulder. The incredible people there inspire me every day. However, it&#8217;s time for a new adventure. I&#8217;m off to Europe!

I&#8217;ve decided to spend the month of September exploring other Impact Hubs. I want to set an example for members, encourage collaboration across borders, and raise awareness around the Impact Hub Passport. The Impact Hub Passport is currently being redesigned to allow members to move between different hubs with greater ease.

I&#8217;ll be starting out in Stockholm, passing through Berlin, and finishing in San Sebastian. There will be other stops along the way too! (Munich, Prague, Vienna..?) Let me know if you or any of your nerd friends will be attending <a href="http://nordicjs.com/" target="_blank">Nordic.js</a> or <a href="http://rejectjs.org/" target="_blank">Reject.js</a>, as I&#8217;ll be going to both JavaScript conferences.

The trip was inspired by <a href="http://www.impacthub.net/2014/06/14/impact-hub-global-network-effect/" target="_blank">this fantastic post</a> from Brian Howe and conversations with Matthias Reisinger, who is leading the effort on the new passport program. Greg Berry, Shannon Sunderland, and Lindsey Brown have encouraged and supported me. Thanks to them, I&#8217;ll have Impact Hub Boulder gifts and plenty of good vibes to bring with me on my journey.

Please come and say hello if you see me at your hub! Stay tuned for more posts.
