We have had some amazing conversations over the last couple of months at <a title="BLDRPPL" href="https://twitter.com/BLDRPPL" target="_blank">BLDRPPL</a>. Our third fullÂ episode will be finished sometime this week. While each person featured so far has been very unique and interesting, I hope that we can branch out further over the next year and have slightly more frequent posts. Also, if anyone is aware of a sponsor who would be willing to donate space for less than an hour every couple of weeks for a quiet interview, please let us know!

## Branching Out

The tech sceneÂ in Boulder is amazing, but it is only one small component of the community here. Do you want to be a contributor by having conversations with people that you look up to? Maybe they are musicians, artists, or local business owners. I will continue doing my best to meet with different people within the community, but please feel free to <a title="reach out" href="http://www.bldrppl.com/?page_id=2" target="_blank">reach out</a> if you want to participate.

## More Frequent Posts

I can&#8217;t guarantee that we will have a new episode every week, but I am going to hold myself to the goal of bi-monthly interviews with awesome people.

## Sponsorship?

This is not a business trying to make money with advertising, but we would rep a sponsor if they are willing to let us do interviews there! This would be less than an hour every couple of weeks in a space where there isn&#8217;t too much background noise. For now, it is just audio, but it the future it could potentially include video. Think about it ðŸ™‚
