I love being a member of <a href="http://www.impacthubboulder.com/" target="_blank">Impact HUB Boulder</a>! The community here has helped me grow both personally and professionally. While my experience locally has been amazing, I know that there is more out there, and have put together a letter in anticipation of a stay in Europe this fall. A few members of the leadership team will be passing this along to other Impact HUB directors at gatherings over the coming months:

> Greetings!
> 
> My name is Sean Helvey and I am a member of Impact HUB Boulder. I&#8217;d like to spend some time abroad this fall, and while working at another Impact HUB sounds fantastic to me, we might be able to craft the journey in a way that would benefit every one of our members. Let&#8217;s take this as an opportunity to promote the Impact HUB Passport and increase the interconnectedness of our network.
> 
> I&#8217;ll happily serve as an ambassador for Boulder, bringing back pictures and stories of people that I meet along the way. This could lead to a more robust infrastructure for would-be travelers looking to rent a room and work at another Impact HUB. We ought to have a series of blog posts dedicated to Impact HUB Global and members who transcend borders in search of a different perspective. We can collaborate and encourage this cross-pollination.
> 
> I&#8217;ll only be able to visit one continent this fall (probably Europe). However, I am hopeful that this will lead to other visits in the future, possibly including South America and Asia during 2016. I speak a little bit of Spanish, and am very interested in Central and Northern Europe. The biggest challenge is finding a group of people who have the capacity and are receptive to having a guest. I work remotely as a [Software Developer](http://www.seanhelvey.com/about/) for one main client in Denver at the moment and spend my free time teaching kids programming as a Champion of [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.com/) Boulder.

> Thank you for taking the time to read this! I haven&#8217;t purchased a flight or rented an apartment yet, so please reach out if you have any input. Let&#8217;s work together to foster the global community that is ImpactHUB by supporting members who travel and work abroad.

I&#8217;ll follow up with another post once the details of the trip emerge, so please stay tuned!
