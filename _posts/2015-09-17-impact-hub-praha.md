It was impossible for me to take pictures when I first arrived in Praha (Prague). Everything was so magnificent and cohesive, that capturing any little part of it wasn&#8217;t going to do the city justice. This is a incredibly beautiful place. However, it is the people here that make it special.

Working at Impact Hub Praha gave me a glimpse into the heart of Czech culture. Tomas Surovcik and Jan Říha took me out to lunch, gave me advice on things to do, and helped me find a cheap bus to Munich at the end of my stay. Hosts Danka Nováková and Peter Šedivý were extremely friendly and helpful. I was also able to re-connect with Impact Hub Praha member Felix Palmer who I had met at Nordic.js in Stockholm the prior week.

I was blown away by the sheer size of the co-working area. It&#8217;s very large relative to other Impact Hubs I have been to, and I was told that this is the second largest in the world! The space was literally humming with energy.

### Tips from Sean

  * Everyone speaks English, but why not learn some Czech? Smile and say &#8220;děkuji&#8221; instead of thank you. Locals will appreciate the effort! Hello is &#8220;ahoj&#8221; (pronounced &#8220;ahoy&#8221; like a sailor).
  * <a href="http://www.google.com/ncr" target="_blank">www.google.com/ncr</a> is a nice way to prevent google from redirecting your searches according to your geolocation. It will give you the same one from home in the language that you are used to.

### What can we learn from Impact Hub Praha?

The three Impact Hubs in the Czech Republic provide members with seamless access across each of the co-working spaces. I&#8217;d love to see something like that in the states. They also have a 3D printer and a full bar / kitchen area where people pay for what they use (see the picture of money in the gallery above).

Thank you for the hospitality, Impact Hub Praha! I&#8217;ll never forget the experience.
