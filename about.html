  <h1 class="page-heading">About</h1>

    <p>
    I started programming in quantitative finance classes at <a href="http://www.calpoly.edu/">Cal Poly SLO</a> and built option pricing models on Wall Street before completing a Master's Degree in Computer Science at NYU's <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/">Courant Institute</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Since moving to Boulder I have worked at startups, agencies, and large corporations. I ran my own consulting business called <a href="http://www.bluehook.co/">Blue Hook</a> for three years and built machine learning systems using Python, Go, MongoDB, and Docker at Pearson before becoming a Lead Instructor at Galvanize.

    I spend my free time playing with Elm, Rust, and Kotlin. I'm a co-organizer of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Front-range-elm">Front Range Elm</a> and the creator of <a href="http://www.valunicorn.me/">Valunicorn</a>. Please feel free to reach out!
