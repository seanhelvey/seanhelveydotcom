I hope that Impact Hub Berlin never changes. Members will come and go, superficial improvements may happen over time, but the warm and colorful community there can withstand all of it. To understand this co-working space, you have to know <a href="https://zurich.impacthub.ch/impact-hub-berlin/" target="_blank">its history</a> and the people behind it.

One prior endeavor to form Impact Hub Berlin failed. A different group within the community rallied and made another attempt at a prototype, but it still wasn&#8217;t clear that the organization would be sustainable. Finally, the effort was successful, and the people here have the space that they always wanted. Take a look at some of the pictures from the renovation below.

This space was designed by members Margit Sichrovsky and Kim le Roux of <http://www.lxsy.de/>. They are creating some incredible social funding opportunities in South Africa with their work in Gap Housing. The pair has also made their mark on Impact Hub Berlin in a number of unique ways.

The &#8220;focus area&#8221; has an incredible little nook and another section for taking naps! The cafe has a secret spot above the kitchen which can only be accessed with a ladder. The phone booth is unique from every one that I&#8217;ve ever seen as is the teams&#8217;s commitment to updating and improving the space. The signage out front was being replaced during my week there.

I was blown away by the friendly hosts and team members from Impact Hub Berlin. Isabel, Nicole, Steph, and Jonas made me feel right at home. Matt took me out for a traditional German lunch with some awesome Hub Global folks. Vishal Jodhani is the most extraordinary community catalyst and connector that I have ever met! These people are simply amazing.

It was a pleasure to meet Benjamin Snow of <a href="https://berlin.impacthub.net/2015/09/30/member-stories-meet-civocracy/" target="_blank">Civocracy.org</a>, who also hails from Colorado. Brock LeMieux made an attempt at starting Impact Hub Oslo before finding his place here in Berlin, but I am hoping he comes back to Boulder at some point, as he has also spent some time in Colorado. Anula and Alexandra gave me an interesting local perspective along with some fantastic book recommendations.

This post is dedicated to all of the people who have started or participated in the creation of an Impact Hub around the world, even those who have failed along the way, and anyone who would consider themselves a member of the community. These places don&#8217;t exist in a vacuum. Individuals dream about creating them, but they build teams to make it happen, and work together with many different parties throughout the process (see <a href="https://zurich.impacthub.ch/impact-hub-manila/" target="_blank">“What does it take to open an Impact Hub?”</a>).

Thank you for allowing me to visit and tell this story! My hope is that these posts inspire people to become members and tempt existing members into visiting other locations. I&#8217;m absolutely inspired after seeing all of it and I&#8217;m sure that you will be too.
