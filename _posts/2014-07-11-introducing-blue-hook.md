Blue Hook, a boutique consultancy headquartered in Boulder, is helping startups grow through a renewed focus on quality. While they have expertise in mobile web and API development, Blue Hook would like to have a bigger impact on entire teams and work with businesses at a higher level. Sean Helvey, the Founder of Blue Hook, was originally a <a href="http://boulderstartupweek.com/" target="_blank">Boulder Startup Week</a> &#8220;Fly-In&#8221; and is still very actively involved in the Boulder community.

The company has been in development at the <a href="http://www.impacthubboulder.com/" target="_blank">Impact Hub Boulder</a> over the last couple of months. Open space there has created many exciting opportunities for collaboration and a variety of events at The Hub have enriched the company philosophy. In order to become more involved with the local business community, Blue Hook recently became a member of the <a href="http://www.boulderiba.org/" target="_blank">Boulder County Independent Business Alliance</a> (BIBA).

Sean will be volunteering with the organization on various initiatives including education over the next couple of months. He is excited about the possibility of mixing up the technology centric startup community with the broader business community throughout Boulder. If you haven&#8217;t heard of BIBA, sign up for their <a href="http://www.boulderiba.org/newsletter.html" target="_blank">newsletter</a>, and keep an eye out for more events toward the end of the summer.
