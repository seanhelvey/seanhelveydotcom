My first experience developing software was in a group setting. It became clear to me that the three of us working in the lab were able to get more done than any one of us would have been able to independently. I could chime in when something made sense to me and listen closely if another person had a unique insight into a problem. The <a title="romanticized notion" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odOzMz-fOOw" target="_blank">romanticized notion</a> of a lone wolf hacker had no place there. We were working together as a team.

Since then I have found working in the industry that you actually do come across the occasional <a title="BOFH" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastard_Operator_From_Hell" target="_blank">BOFH</a>. You walk into a new job or start freelancing on a project and find someone who doesn&#8217;t &#8220;play well with others&#8221;. Maybe they didn&#8217;t participate in any sort of team activity growing up. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a sport. Social groups such as bands, clubs, and volunteer organizations are a great introduction to the world of software engineering. Teams need leadership, communication, and vested interests in addition to highly skilled people.
